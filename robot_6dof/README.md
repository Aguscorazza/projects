# Kinematic Analysis of a 6 DoF Robot
#### Robotics
This project consisted of proposing an industrial application and seeing its possible realization through the use of industrial robots. The work focused mainly on kinematic analysis of the robot, that is to say they have not been considered dynamic effects in the study. We've carried out a study of the Direct & Inverse Kinematics of the robots as well as the analysis of the relation of velocities by using the Jacobian, the detection of singularities and, finally, the planning and generation of robots' trajectories.

In this case, it was proposed to implement 3 industrial robots (KUKA KR 120 R2100 nano F exlusive) for use in a series assembly line of a foundry parts factory.

This project was made as part of the Robotics Course at Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. A complete report in Spanish and a full animation of the movement of each robot are provided in this repository.
