# Rock-Paper-Scissors using Computer Vision
#### Computer Vision
The objective of this project is to build a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game using OpenCV to detect automatically whether you choose to play Rock, Paper or Scissors against an opponent controlled by an AI.

At this moment, the algorithm to detect the player's move is based on counting the number of fingers in the player's hand. Nevertheless, I would like to implement an AI detection algorithm using Convolutional Neural Networks in a near future.

The computer's move are being generated randomly at this moment. I will implement soon an AI decision-making strategy to select the best possible play.
