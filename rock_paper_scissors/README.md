# Rock-Paper-Scissors using Computer Vision
#### Computer Vision
The objective of this project is to build a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game using OpenCV to detect automatically whether you choose to play Rock, Paper or Scissors against an opponent controlled by an AI.

Presently, our move detection method relies on finger counting, but we're gearing up for a substantial enhancement. In the near future, we plan to implement an advanced AI detection algorithm leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This upgrade promises a significant boost in accuracy and sophistication, providing a more nuanced interpretation of player gestures.

On the computational side, the computer's moves are currently generated through a 2nd-order Markov Chain predictor, a sophisticated approach that ensures strategic and dynamic responses.
