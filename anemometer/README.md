# Anemometer
#### Electronics & Programming
The project consisted of making an anemometer, which allow us to measure the wind speed and direction, using an Arduino UNO. All the pieces used in the construction have been designed and 3D printed.

To measure the direction the anemometer has as absolute encoder (builded using 3 infrarred sensors CNY70). The wind speed is measured using an optocoupler.
